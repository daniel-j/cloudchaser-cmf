How to install
--------------

Clone the repository and load it up in an apache webserver enviroment.
It required mod_rewrite to be active. It also requires PHP's PDO and SQlite modules to be enabled.

chmod the site/data folder so that it's writeable by php.

Point your browser to the root of Cloudchaser, click Modules and install. This will create the required database tables.

You should then be able to log in as admin with the username root and password root.

Now go to modules and install to add the example content.

Enjoy Cloudchaser CMF!
